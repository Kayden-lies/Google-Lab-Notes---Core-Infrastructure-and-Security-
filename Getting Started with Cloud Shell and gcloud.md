# Getting Started with Cloud Shell and gcloud

## üß≠ Objective
Learn how to:
- Launch and use **Google Cloud Shell**
- Use the **gcloud CLI** to interact with Google Cloud resources

---

## üß∞ Tools Introduced
- **Google Cloud Shell**: An interactive shell preloaded with tools and libraries to manage GCP resources. No setup required.
- **gcloud CLI**: The main command-line tool for managing Google Cloud services.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Concepts

### Launching Cloud Shell
- Access from the GCP Console (top-right corner).
- Debian-based shell with **5 GB persistent storage**.
- Pre-installed tools: `gcloud`, `gsutil`, `bq`, `kubectl`, etc.

### Basic gcloud Commands
```bash
gcloud init                   # Initialize gcloud configuration
gcloud auth list             # Show authenticated accounts
gcloud config list           # Show active configuration
gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID]  # Set your active GCP project
gcloud compute zones list    # List available compute zones
```

### Projects and Configuration
- Projects organize resources and billing.
- Proper configuration is essential for CLI functionality.
- Always ensure your project is correctly set.

---

## üß™ Hands-On Tasks
```bash
# Start gcloud setup
gcloud init

# Check authentication
gcloud auth list

# View current config
gcloud config list

# Set your project
gcloud config set project [YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

# List compute zones
gcloud compute zones list
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips & Troubleshooting
- If commands fail:
  - Check authentication
  - Verify the correct project is set
- Use `gcloud help` or `gcloud [command] --help` for guidance

---

## üß† Why It Matters
- **Cloud Shell** eliminates local setup hassles.
- **gcloud CLI** is powerful for automating and managing cloud infrastructure efficiently.
